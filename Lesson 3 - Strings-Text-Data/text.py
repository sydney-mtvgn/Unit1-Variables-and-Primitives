# Lesson 3: String Basics - Simple Name Builder

# Part 1: Creating string variables
first_name = "Alex"
last_name = "Doe"
favorite_number = '5'
lucky_number = 0
gpa = 4.0

print(f"Type of favorite number {type(favorite_number)}")
print(f"Type of favorite number {type(lucky_number)}")
# Part 2: Combining strings
full_name = first_name + " " + last_name # must be str + str
print(f"Full Name: {full_name}")
print(f"{first_name}'s GPA is {gpa-1}")
print(first_name + "'s" + "GPA is" + str(gpa))
# Part 3: String repetition
print("=" * 50)
cheer = ("Go " + first_name + "!") * 3
print(cheer)
# Part 4: String length
print(len(first_name))
print(f"Length of cheer: {len(cheer)}")

space = ""
print(len(space))
# Part 5: Indexing and Slicing
school = "Bergen Tech!"
print(school)
print(f"Length of school: {len(school)}")
print(school[0]) # first index
print(school[1])
print(school[2])

#negative indexing
print(school[-1]) # last index
print(school[-2]) 
# print(school[12]) # error index
print(school[11]) # also last character
print(school[len(school)-1]) # also last character

school = "Bergen Tech"
