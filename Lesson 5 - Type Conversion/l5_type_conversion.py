# Python Type Conversion Practice - Starter File

# ====== CODE ALONG SECTION 1: Age Calculator Fix ======
# The wrong way (this will cause an error):
# user_age = "16"
# next_year = user_age + 1


# The right way - follow along with teacher:
# Convert the string to integer first



# ====== CODE ALONG SECTION 2: Boolean Testing ======



# ====== CODE ALONE CHALLENGE 1: Fix These Errors! ======
# Fix these broken code snippets:

# Problem 1 - height calculation
# height = "5.8"
# height_in_inches = height * 12

# Problem 2 - string concatenation with number
# test_score = 95
# message = "You scored " + test_score + " points!"

# Problem 3 - cost calculation
# items = "5"
# total_cost = items * 2.99


# ====== CODE ALONE CHALLENGE 2: Grade Calculator ======
# Build a grade calculator:

# You have these grade strings:
math_grade = "85"
science_grade = "92.5" 
english_grade = "78"

# Your tasks:
# 1. Convert all to numbers (appropriate types)
# 2. Calculate the average
# 3. Determine if average >= 80 (honor roll)
# 4. Create a report message using f-strings


# ====== BONUS - CODE ALONE CHALLENGE: User Profile Builder ======
# Create a complete program:

# Simulated user input (as strings):
user_name = "Jordan"
user_age_str = "17"
fav_number_str = "21"
has_license_str = "yes"

# Your tasks:
# 1. Convert each to appropriate types
# 2. Calculate age in 10 years
# 3. Check if favorite number is even
# 4. Convert "yes"/"no" to True/False for license
# 5. Create a complete profile report
